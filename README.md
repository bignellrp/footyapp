# footyapp

A web app for managing a 5 a side footy team.

Select the players using the checkboxes and it should output a balanced team for each side.

Coded using Python, HTML and Flask. (HTML taken from https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale)

You can test this by installing this docker image and cloning this repo to replace the contents of the /app folder

Future Plans for the app:

- Move class to a separate file
- Make a new fuction for the app for comparing manually selected teams
- Add a menu to the app for selecting different fuctions
- Make a new fuction for adding, editing or removing player stats
